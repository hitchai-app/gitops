# GitLab Runner with Kubernetes Executor + Docker-in-Docker
#
# Architecture: Runner manager polls GitLab for jobs, spawns job pods dynamically
# Each job pod gets its own DinD service container for Docker builds/tests
#
# Resource Strategy (similar to ARC):
# - Runner manager: Small footprint (polls for jobs)
# - Job pods: Spawned on-demand with DinD sidecar
# - tmpfs volumes for Docker storage (RAM-backed for performance)

# GitLab server URL
gitlabUrl: https://gitlab.ops.last-try.org

# Runner token from sealed secret
# Create via: GitLab Admin > CI/CD > Runners > New instance runner
