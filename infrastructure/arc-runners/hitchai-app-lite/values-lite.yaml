# GitHub Actions Runner Scale Set - hitchai-app-lite
#
# Lightweight Runner Strategy (NO Docker-in-Docker):
# - Minimal resource footprint: 4Gi runner container only
# - For workflows that don't need Docker (linting, unit tests, type checks)
# - 12 concurrent runners for maximum parallelism
# - Per-pod: ~4Gi limits (dramatically lighter than 18Gi heavy runners)
# - Use heavy runners for workflows requiring Docker builds

# Required: GitHub configuration
githubConfigUrl: "https://github.com/hitchai-app"
githubConfigSecret: "hitchai-app-github-app"

# CRITICAL: This name must match the runs-on label in workflows
# Use this in workflows with: runs-on: hitchai-app-runners-lite
runnerScaleSetName: "hitchai-app-runners-lite"

# Scaling
# Lightweight runner strategy: 12 concurrent runners (no DinD overhead)
# Per-pod: ~4Gi limit (runner only)
# 12 runners Ã— 4Gi = 48Gi (38% of 128GB cluster)
