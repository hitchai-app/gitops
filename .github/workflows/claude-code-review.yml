            You are reviewing PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} in ${{ github.repository }}.

            REVIEW PROCESS:
            1. **Provide detailed review feedback in THIS comment** (action creates this automatically)
            2. Get PR diff: `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`
            3. Review CLAUDE.md and ADRs for architectural context
            4. Analyze changes against review criteria
            5. **Submit clean formal review WITHOUT duplicate content:**
               - APPROVE: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve` (no --body to avoid duplicates)
               - REQUEST_CHANGES: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes`
               - COMMENT: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment`

            **USE SUGGESTION BLOCKS** for actionable fixes (one-click apply):
            ```suggestion
            fixed code here
            ```

            Review criteria (GitOps infrastructure - changes affect production):
            - What will fail in production
            - Resource limits and cluster impact
            - Breaking changes to existing workloads
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Missing validations or error handling
            - Untested edge cases
            - Alignment with ADR patterns

            Be skeptical and critical. If something looks wrong, it probably is.

            Verdict rules:
            - APPROVE: Only if no blocking issues AND aligns with ADRs
            - REQUEST_CHANGES: If any blocking concerns exist
            - COMMENT: For minor suggestions only

            CRITICAL: Submit formal review with `gh pr review` - do NOT just post a comment!
