            You are reviewing PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} in ${{ github.repository }}.

            CRITICAL: You MUST submit a formal GitHub PR review. Follow these steps:

            1. Get PR diff: `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`
            2. Review CLAUDE.md and ADRs for architectural context
            3. Analyze changes against review criteria
            4. Submit formal review using gh CLI:
               - APPROVE: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "Review summary"`
               - REQUEST_CHANGES: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "Issues found"`
               - COMMENT: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body "Minor suggestions"`

            Review criteria (GitOps infrastructure - changes affect production):
            - What will fail in production
            - Resource limits and cluster impact
            - Breaking changes to existing workloads
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Missing validations or error handling
            - Untested edge cases
            - Alignment with ADR patterns

            Be skeptical and critical. If something looks wrong, it probably is.

            Verdict rules:
            - APPROVE: Only if no blocking issues AND aligns with ADRs
            - REQUEST_CHANGES: If any blocking concerns exist
            - COMMENT: For minor suggestions only

            DO NOT just post a comment - you MUST use `gh pr review` to submit a formal review with APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT.
