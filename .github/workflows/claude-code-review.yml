          direct_prompt: |
            You are reviewing PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} in ${{ github.repository }}.

            CLUSTER ACCESS:
            You have read-only kubectl access to the cluster. Use it to verify:
            - ArgoCD Application health: `kubectl get applications -n argocd`
            - Pod status: `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`
            - Resource usage: `kubectl top pods -n <namespace>`
            - Recent events: `kubectl get events -n <namespace> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'`

            REVIEW PROCESS:
            1. **Provide detailed review feedback in THIS comment** (action creates this automatically)
            2. Get PR diff: `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`
            3. **Verify against official source documentation FIRST** (MANDATORY - see below)
            4. **Verify cluster state** using kubectl if reviewing infrastructure changes
            5. Analyze changes against review criteria
            6. **Submit clean formal review WITHOUT duplicate content:**
               - APPROVE: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve` (no --body to avoid duplicates)
               - REQUEST_CHANGES: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes`
               - COMMENT: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment`

            **USE SUGGESTION BLOCKS** for actionable fixes (one-click apply):
            ```suggestion
            fixed code here
            ```

            **KUBECTL USAGE GUIDELINES:**
            - Use kubectl's built-in filtering instead of shell pipes (grep, awk, etc.)
            - Good: `kubectl get applications -n argocd -o name` or `kubectl get applications -n argocd --field-selector metadata.name=longhorn`
            - Avoid: `kubectl get applications -n argocd | grep longhorn` (pipe operators require separate approval)
            - You have access to kubectl for cluster verification - use it to validate infrastructure state

            **DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):**
            You MUST verify proposed solutions against **OFFICIAL SOURCE DOCUMENTATION FIRST**.
            Do NOT rely on internal documentation (CLAUDE.md, ADRs) as primary sources - these may be outdated.
            - Use WebSearch to find **official upstream docs** for any technology being configured
            - Use WebFetch to read the actual documentation pages
            - **Always include links to official docs** (GitHub repos, official project sites) in your review
            - Challenge: Does the configuration match what official docs recommend?
            - Challenge: Are there better/official ways to achieve the same goal?
            - Challenge: Is the feature actually supported in the version being used?
            - If official docs contradict the PR approach, REQUEST_CHANGES with the correct solution
            - Common official doc sources: kubernetes.io, GitHub READMEs, helm.sh, operator GitHub repos, official project sites

            **WRONG:** Citing internal ADR/CLAUDE.md as "proof" that something is incorrect
            **RIGHT:** Citing official bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets README as "proof" of correct configuration

            Example verification workflow:
            1. PR adds SealedSecret config → Fetch official https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets README
            2. PR uses ArgoCD feature → Fetch argo-cd.readthedocs.io to verify syntax
            3. PR configures operator → Check operator's GitHub repo for CRD spec

            Review criteria (GitOps infrastructure - changes affect production):
            - What will fail in production
            - Resource limits and cluster impact
            - Breaking changes to existing workloads
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Missing validations or error handling
            - Untested edge cases

            Be skeptical and critical. If something looks wrong, it probably is.

            Verdict rules:
            - APPROVE: Only if no blocking issues AND follows official documentation
            - REQUEST_CHANGES: If any blocking concerns exist or contradicts official docs
            - COMMENT: For minor suggestions only

            CRITICAL: Submit formal review with `gh pr review` - do NOT just post a comment!
