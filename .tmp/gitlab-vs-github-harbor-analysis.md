# GitLab vs GitHub + Harbor Strategic Analysis

## Context

You've been thinking about GitLab. This fundamentally changes the Harbor evaluation because:
- **GitLab has built-in container registry** (Harbor might be redundant)
- **GitLab is an all-in-one platform** (SCM + CI/CD + Registry + Security)
- **You're currently on GitHub** with Actions Runner Controller (ADR 0014)
- **Small team values operational simplicity** (per multiple ADRs)

## Critical Questions Before Analyzing

### 1. Why are you considering GitLab?

**Possible reasons:**
- ☐ Self-hosted source control (don't trust GitHub with private code)
- ☐ Unified platform (don't want to manage multiple tools)
- ☐ Cost concerns (GitHub pricing vs self-hosted GitLab)
- ☐ Better CI/CD features (GitLab CI vs Actions)
- ☐ Integrated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)
- ☐ GitLab-specific features (issue boards, wiki, planning tools)
- ☐ Avoid vendor lock-in (prefer self-hosted)

**Please clarify your primary motivation** - the answer dramatically changes the recommendation.

### 2. What's the current GitHub pain point?

- Is it the **cost** of private repos/Actions minutes?
- Is it **trust/privacy** concerns with GitHub?
- Is it **workflow limitations** in GitHub Actions?
- Is it the **fragmentation** of tools (GitHub + Harbor + separate scanning)?
- Is it **feature envy** (GitLab has something GitHub lacks)?

### 3. How much operational complexity can the team absorb?

GitLab is **significantly heavier** than GitHub + Harbor:
- GitHub + Harbor: ~1.5GB RAM (Harbor components)
- GitLab: **~8-12GB RAM** (Rails, Gitaly, PostgreSQL, Redis, registry, Sidekiq, etc.)

Can your team handle:
- GitLab upgrades (multi-component, complex migrations)
- Rails application debugging (when things break)
- PostgreSQL performance tuning for GitLab
- Gitaly storage management
- Runner management (GitLab CI runners, different from Actions)

## Option A: Migrate to GitLab (All-in-One Platform)

### What You Get

**Unified Platform:**
- Source control (Git repositories)
- CI/CD (GitLab CI)
- Container registry (built-in)
- Security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency, container)
- Issue tracking, wikis, boards
- Package registry (npm, Maven, PyPI, etc.)

**No Harbor needed** - GitLab's registry includes:
- Vulnerability scanning (Trivy-based)
- Tag retention policies
- Authentication/authorization
- Web UI

### Resource Requirements

**GitLab Omnibus (minimal):**
```
PostgreSQL:        2-3GB RAM
Redis:             500MB RAM
Rails (Puma):      2-3GB RAM
Gitaly:            1-2GB RAM
Sidekiq:           1-2GB RAM
Registry:          500MB RAM
GitLab Runner:     Variable (500MB-2GB per job)
---------------------------------
Total:             ~8-12GB RAM
```

**Storage:**
- Git repositories: ~50-100GB initially
- Container registry: ~100GB initially
- CI artifacts: ~50GB initially

**CPU:** 4-8 cores recommended for responsive UI

### Migration Effort

**Phase 1: Setup (3-5 days)**
- Deploy GitLab via Helm chart
- Configure external PostgreSQL (CloudNativePG)
- Configure external Redis (Valkey)
- Set up TLS certificates
- Configure SMTP, LDAP/OAuth
- Test basic Git operations

**Phase 2: Migration (1-2 weeks)**
- Migrate repositories from GitHub (can use GitHub importer)
- Rewrite all GitHub Actions workflows to GitLab CI YAML (different syntax!)
- Migrate secrets and variables
- Update developer workflows (new URLs, new CLI)
- Set up new CI runners (not ARC, GitLab Runners)
- Test all pipelines

**Phase 3: Decommission (1 week)**
- Archive GitHub repos
- Decommission ARC runners
- Update documentation
- Team training

**Total: 3-4 weeks full-time effort**

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Costs:**
- ❌ **Massive migration effort** (3-4 weeks, team disruption)
- ❌ **Heavy resource usage** (8-12GB RAM, 4-8 CPU cores)
- ❌ **Complex operations** (Rails debugging, Gitaly, multi-component upgrades)
- ❌ **Rewrite all CI/CD** (GitHub Actions YAML ≠ GitLab CI YAML)
- ❌ **Team learning curve** (new UI, new CLI, new concepts)
- ❌ **Waste existing investment** (ARC setup, optimized workflows, team knowledge)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single platform** (everything in one place)
- ✅ **Integrated security** (SAST/DAST built-in)
- ✅ **Self-hosted** (full control, privacy)
- ✅ **No GitHub costs** (if that's the concern)
- ✅ **Unified permissions** (one RBAC system)

**Verdict: Only if you have strong reasons (privacy, cost, or specific features)**

## Option B: GitHub + Harbor (Best-of-Breed)

### What You Get

**Existing GitHub setup + Harbor:**
- Source control (GitHub)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions with ARC runners - already deployed!)
- Container registry (Harbor with Trivy scanning)
- Security (Trivy for containers, GitHub Dependabot for code)

**No GitLab overhead** - leverage what's working:
- ARC runners already optimized (ADR 0014)
- Workflows already written and tested
- Team already knows GitHub Actions
- DinD configurations already tuned

### Resource Requirements

**Additional (Harbor only):**
```
Harbor core:       300-500MB RAM
Harbor jobservice: 100-200MB RAM
Harbor portal:     50-100MB RAM
Trivy:             200-300MB RAM
PostgreSQL:        Shared (CloudNativePG)
Redis:             Shared (Valkey)
---------------------------------
Total additional:  ~650MB-1.1GB RAM
```

**Much lighter than GitLab!**

### Migration Effort

**Harbor deployment (1-2 days):**
- Deploy Harbor via Helm
- Configure proxy cache for Docker Hub, GHCR, gcr.io, quay.io
- Migrate cached images from old registry
- Update runner configs to use Harbor
- Test workflows

**No workflow rewrites** - GitHub Actions YAML stays the same!

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Costs:**
- ❌ **Two platforms** (GitHub for code, Harbor for images)
- ❌ **No integrated SAST/DAST** (need separate tools if wanted)
- ❌ **Harbor operational complexity** (5 components vs 1 registry)
- ⚠️ **GitHub costs** (if private repos/Actions minutes are expensive)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Minimal migration** (1-2 days vs 3-4 weeks)
- ✅ **Leverage existing investment** (ARC, workflows, team knowledge)
- ✅ **Much lighter** (~1GB RAM vs 8-12GB)
- ✅ **Less operational complexity** (Harbor vs full GitLab)
- ✅ **Team productivity** (no learning curve, no rewriting workflows)
- ✅ **Incremental** (can evaluate GitLab later without commitment)

**Verdict: Better if GitHub works and you just need better registry**

## Option C: Stay with GitHub + Simple Registry (Current)

### What You Have

- Source control (GitHub)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions with ARC)
- Container registry (Docker Registry v2 pull-through cache)

**If you're happy with GitHub, maybe you don't need Harbor OR GitLab?**

### When This Works

**Stay simple if:**
- ✅ Container vulnerabilities are **low priority** (accept risk)
- ✅ Only pulling from **Docker Hub** (GHCR/gcr.io not heavily used)
- ✅ **No internal image builds** needing storage (or use GHCR for that)
- ✅ **Small team** can't absorb Harbor/GitLab complexity

**This is the lightest option** - don't add complexity without clear need.

## Recommendation Framework

### Choose GitLab if:

**All of these are true:**
1. ✅ **Strong motivation** - Privacy concerns, specific features, or hate GitHub
2. ✅ **Team capacity** - Can absorb 8-12GB RAM + operational complexity
3. ✅ **Long-term commitment** - Not evaluating, actually migrating
4. ✅ **Migration capacity** - Can dedicate 3-4 weeks to migration
5. ✅ **Value unified platform** - Willing to pay operational cost for integration

**If even one is false, GitLab is probably wrong choice.**

### Choose GitHub + Harbor if:

**All of these are true:**
1. ✅ **Happy with GitHub** - No urgent need to migrate SCM/CI
2. ✅ **Need registry improvements** - Security, multi-registry caching, RBAC
3. ✅ **Want incremental change** - 1-2 days migration, keep workflows
4. ✅ **Have 1GB RAM to spare** - Harbor fits in single-node budget
5. ✅ **Value best-of-breed** - Prefer specialized tools over all-in-one

**This is the pragmatic middle ground.**

### Choose GitHub + Simple Registry if:

**All of these are true:**
1. ✅ **Current setup works** - No pain points with registry
2. ✅ **Security not critical** (yet) - Can accept unknown CVEs short-term
3. ✅ **Minimal ops capacity** - Team maxed out, can't add more
4. ✅ **Single-node constraints** - Every GB of RAM matters
5. ✅ **Small scale** - Not pulling from many external registries

**This is the "don't fix what isn't broken" option.**

## The GitLab Trap

**Warning: GitLab looks attractive as "unified platform" but...**

### Common Mistake

1. "We need a registry" → Consider Harbor
2. "Harbor has multiple components" → Seems complex
3. "GitLab has everything built-in!" → Looks simpler
4. **Deploy GitLab** → Actually 10x more complex than Harbor
5. **Regret** → Stuck maintaining GitLab or costly migration back

### Reality Check

**GitLab is NOT simpler** - it's:
- Rails application (requires Rails debugging skills)
- Multi-process architecture (Puma, Sidekiq, Gitaly, Workhorse)
- Complex upgrades (database migrations, API changes)
- Heavy resource usage (8-12GB minimum)
- Different CI/CD syntax (rewrite all workflows)

**Harbor is complex for a registry, but simple compared to GitLab.**

### When GitLab Actually Makes Sense

**Rare scenarios where GitLab wins:**
1. **Privacy/compliance requirement** - Must self-host source control
2. **Leaving GitHub anyway** - Already decided to migrate, GitLab best alternative
3. **Large team with GitLab experience** - Team knows GitLab operations
4. **Need GitLab-specific features** - Issue boards, advanced planning tools
5. **Budget constraint** - GitHub Enterprise costs > self-hosted GitLab costs

**For most teams: GitHub + Harbor is the sweet spot.**

## My Skeptical Take

### If you're considering GitLab for the registry...

**Don't.** That's like buying a car because you need a cup holder. GitLab's registry is a small feature in a massive platform.

**Harbor solves registry problems without:**
- Rewriting all your CI/CD
- Migrating all your repositories
- Learning a new platform
- Running a Rails application
- Spending 3-4 weeks on migration

### If you're considering GitLab for other reasons...

**That's different.** If you have legitimate reasons to leave GitHub (privacy, features, cost), then:

1. Evaluate GitLab for those reasons (not registry)
2. If GitLab wins, its built-in registry is a bonus
3. Harbor becomes irrelevant (use GitLab's registry)

**But be honest about the migration cost:**
- 3-4 weeks of team time
- Rewrite all workflows
- 8-12GB RAM permanent cost
- Complex operational burden

## What Information Do I Need?

To give you a proper recommendation, answer these:

### Question 1: Why are you thinking about GitLab?

Is it:
- A) **Privacy/trust** - Don't want code on GitHub's servers
- B) **Cost** - GitHub pricing is expensive
- C) **Features** - GitLab has specific features you need
- D) **Integration** - Want unified platform
- E) **Just exploring** - Curious if grass is greener

### Question 2: How committed are you?

- A) **Actively planning migration** - Will definitely switch
- B) **Seriously evaluating** - Might switch if compelling
- C) **Casually curious** - Just want to know options

### Question 3: What's the GitHub pain point?

- A) **No pain** - GitHub works fine, just exploring
- B) **Registry limitations** - Need better image management
- C) **CI/CD limitations** - Actions not meeting needs
- D) **Cost** - Paying too much for GitHub
- E) **Trust** - Uncomfortable with GitHub access to code

### Question 4: Can your team absorb GitLab?

Be honest:
- Can you dedicate **3-4 weeks** to migration?
- Can you spare **8-12GB RAM** permanently?
- Can you handle **Rails debugging** when things break?
- Can you maintain **complex multi-component** system?

## Bottom Line

**If you're thinking about GitLab primarily for the registry:**
→ **Stop. Choose Harbor.** 1/10th the effort, 1/10th the resources, solves the problem.

**If you're thinking about GitLab for other reasons:**
→ **Let's discuss those reasons.** Registry becomes secondary. But be realistic about migration cost.

**If you're just curious about GitLab:**
→ **GitHub + Harbor is safer.** Keep what works, add what you need, defer the big platform migration.

Tell me: What's actually driving the GitLab consideration?
